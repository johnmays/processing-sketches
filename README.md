# Processing Sketches
### Goals:

In the code within this repo, I would like to
- re-learn the Processing language
- familiarize myself with other Processing Foundation tools, such as p5.js and Processing.py
- Make some pieces that actually look good
- Try out some image processing
- Try out some generative artwork

### Project Ideas and Interesting Concepts
- Brownian motion
- ASCII rendering engine or at the very least, image filter
- Floyd-Steinberg Dithering
- Misc. graphs
- Perlin noise
- "living" particles
- transparent block rendering
